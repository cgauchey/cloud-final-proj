### Code Structure:
The React repository's file structure is modular, divided into logical sections that reflect the application's architecture. At the top level, the 'src' folder holds the 'components' directory, which is further categorized into feature-specific subdirectories such as 'companies', 'dashboard', ‘home’, ‘industries’, ‘investors’ and ‘new’. Each subdirectory contains JavaScript files that define the components and their functionality related to that feature. In addition, we have created a ‘common’ folder for reusable components. More information about our code organization and structure can be found in our report.
